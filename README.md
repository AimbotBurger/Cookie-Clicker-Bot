### 🍪 Cookie-Clicker-Bot 🍪

## What is this❓
Cookie Clicker Bot is a bot that will help you farm cookies and buy the upgrades as quick as possible. Although it is far from finished, it is still quite helpful.

## What can it do? 🥠
 At the moment the bot is capable of:
* Using image recognition to find the cookie and click on it faster than any human could dream of.
* Detecting the various panels thanks to i.r in order to find out where the upgrades are.
* Buying upgrades with the click of a button.
* Find golden cookies while clicking at the same time.
* See if an archievemtn has popped up and close it.

## ~~Are you just gonna let it die? ⚰️~~ This is not gonna die
~~I'm not quite sure, since I would like to start with other projects, but I would like to implement a lot of stuff and play with the bot a bit more.~~ I'll try to fix this horrible mess

## What are your plans? 🗺️
I would like to add the following:
* A GUI using tkinter so the bot becomes easier to use and has more funcionalities.
* More funcionalities, maybe even including a tab on the GUI where you can change values, such as the amount of cookies or the amount of farms you own.

## Obstacles 🤹‍♂️
* ~~Lazyness~~ It's not an option anymore.
* ~~Cheat Engine would be required in order to change the values. Which is a pain in the a**.~~ It isn't required at all, this would make the project a cheat instead of a bot (by editting ram).
